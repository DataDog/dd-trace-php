--TEST--
[profiling] test that the profiler doesn't crash on pcntl_fork
--DESCRIPTION--
The profiler does not yet support forking, but it shouldn't crash if the
process is forked. Logging to stderr will acquire a lock, so that's why the
log level is set for this test to the highest setting, to hopefully provide
opportunities to lock or crash if that lock is held.
