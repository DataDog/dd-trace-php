--TEST--
[profiling] profiling should not crash during a `ZEND_GENERATOR_CREATE`
--DESCRIPTION--
We found a segfault when allocation profiling triggers during a
`ZEND_GENERATOR_CREATE`. This is due to a missing `SAVE_OPLINE()` in
https://heap.space/xref/PHP-7.4/Zend/zend_vm_execute.h#1790. This missing
`SAVE_OPLINE()` was added in PHP 8.0.26 with the commit
https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/26c7c82d32dad841dd151ebc6a31b8ea6f93f94a
where also a test was added, that we "borrowed" from that commit.

Note: this does not trigger with PHP 7 when the tracer is enabled, as the tracer
restores the opline in a opcode handler!
