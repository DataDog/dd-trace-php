# Overview

This file explains why we decided to disable specific PHP language tests. Investigations for tests disabled before this file was created are not present.

---

# Categories of tests

## Object/resource ID skips

The following tests are marked as skipped due to the test relying on a hard-coded resource ID. All of these IDs change when the PHP tracer is enabled due to the resources created in the `ddtrace.request_init_hook`.

- `ext/sockets/tests/socket_create_pair.phpt`
- `ext/standard/tests/filters/bug54350.phpt`
- `Zend/tests/type_declarations/scalar_return_basic_64bit.phpt`
- `Zend/tests/weakrefs/weakmap_basic_map_behaviour.phpt`
- `ext/standard/tests/filters/bug54350.phpt`

## Random port selection

Many tests choose a random port to start up a service. Many of these tests have been updated to not used a random port in more recent PHP versions, but we skip these tests in older versions of PHP because they often choose a port that is already in use in CI.

- `ext/sockets/tests/socket_connect_params.phpt` ([Fixed](https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/3e9dac2) in PHP 7.4)

## Fail even with no tracer installed

The following tests fail even when the tracer is not installed.

- `ext/mcrypt/tests/bug67707.phpt` (PHP 7.1 only)
- `ext/mcrypt/tests/bug72535.phpt` (PHP 7.1 only)
- `ext/standard/tests/streams/stream_context_tcp_nodelay_fopen.phpt` (PHP 7.1+)

## Tests relying on `spl_object_id`


- `Zend/tests/gh7958.phpt` (PHP-8.1)

## `var_dump()`-ed objects with additional properties from ObjectKVStore

The following tests assert the output of `var_dump($obj)` and fail because we add the additional properties through `ObjectKVStore`.

- `ext/pdo/tests/pdo_023.phpt` PHP 7+
- `ext/pdo/tests/pdo_030.phpt` PHP 7+
- `ext/pdo_sqlite/tests/bug43831.phpt` PHP 7+
- `ext/pdo_sqlite/tests/bug44327_2.phpt` PHP 7+
- `ext/pdo_sqlite/tests/bug44327_3.phpt` PHP 7+
- `ext/pdo_sqlite/tests/bug48773.phpt` PHP 7+
- `ext/pdo_sqlite/tests/pdo_fetch_func_001.phpt` PHP 7+
- `ext/pdo_sqlite/tests/pdo_sqlite_lastinsertid.phpt` PHP 8.1

## Tests exposing loaded structures of the tracer

- `ext/spl/tests/gh10011.phpt`
- `Zend/tests/gc_045.phpt`

---

# Specific tests

## `sapi/cli/tests/bug80092.phpt`

Temporarily disabled due to a too strict of a check for the precise php -v output.

## `Zend/tests/object_gc_in_shutdown.phpt`, `Zend/tests/bug81104.phpt`, `Zend/tests/gh11189(_1).phpt`, `Zend/tests/gh12073.phpt`

Tests memory limits, which we exceed due to tracer being loaded.

## `Zend/tests/bug63882_2.php`

By _chance_ the internal comparison happens against another GC protected array when arsort()'ing; given that we inject a couple custom global variables in our init.

## `ext/curl/tests/bug76675.phpt`, `ext/curl/tests/bug77535.phpt`

Test does http request to shut down server.

## `ext/curl/tests/curl_postfields_array.phpt`, `ext/curl/tests/curl_setopt_CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING.phpt`

Distributed tracing headers are injected

## `ext/pcntl/tests/pcntl_unshare_01.phpt`

Disabled on versions: `7.4` (it wasn't there on [7.3-](https://github.com/php/php-src/tree/PHP-7.3/ext/pcntl/tests)).

Links to sample broken executions: [7.4](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/DataDog/dd-trace-php/5532/workflows/2d26f68b-fb78-46f1-b846-c9e0f1c5cefc/jobs/377363).

_Investigation_

`unshare` requires processes [not to be threaded](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html) to use the flag `CLONE_NEWUSER`. In our case the background sender is started in a thread and causes the `CLONE_NEWUSER` to be flagged as an error.
Disabling the creation of the background sender thread the test passes (with a delay of 5 seconds).

## `ext/pcntl/tests/pcntl_unshare_03.phpt`

See `ext/pcntl/tests/pcntl_unshare_01.phpt`.

## `ext/openssl/tests/bug74159.phpt`

Disabled on versions: `7.2`.

Caused by openssl version that was upgraded from `1.1.1d` in our pre-existing buster images to `1.1.1n` in the new buster containers. It fails even without the tracing library installed.

## `ext/openssl/tests/openssl_x509_checkpurpose_basic.phpt`

Depends on an expired cert. Was fixed in [php-src/98175fc](https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/98175fc).

## `ext/openssl/tests/tlsv1.0_wrapper.phpt`, `ext/openssl/tests/tlsv1.1_wrapper.phpt`, `ext/openssl/tests/tlsv1.2_wrapper.phpt`

Disabled on versions: `7.0`, `7.1`, `7.2`.

Caused by openssl version that was upgraded from `1.1.1d` in our pre-existing buster images to `1.1.1n` in the new buster containers. It fails even without the tracing library installed.

## `ext/ftp/tests`

Disabled on versions less than 8.1, which switches to ephemeral ports.

Links to sample broken executions: [5.4](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/DataDog/dd-trace-php/5626/workflows/6f8ee4d1-f2dd-4465-b3a0-44f8fde1a18f/jobs/396668/tests#failed-test-0).

_Investigation_

Such tests were skipped before and are incredibly unstable on 5. It might be a CI configuration or something, but they are unstable without the extension as well and it was decided not to spend any more time on these, for now.

## `ext/posix/tests/posix_errno_variation2.phpt`

This test was flaky until it was [fixed in PHP 7.2](https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/f4474e5).

## `ext/standard/tests/streams/proc_open_bug69900.phpt`

* Disabled on versions: `7.0+`.
* [Broken CI build example](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/DataDog/dd-trace-php/5558/workflows/0f25c071-6f6c-4d83-b075-536f6a63369e/jobs/382667)
* This test has [a long history of being flaky in CI](https://github.com/php/php-src/commits/master/ext/standard/tests/streams/proc_open_bug69900.phpt).

## `ext/sockets/tests/socket_create_listen-nobind.phpt`

* Disabled on versions: `7.0 --> 7.3`.
* [Broken CI build example](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/DataDog/dd-trace-php/6016/workflows/dd24ea85-1ec4-47ea-9311-080a66d045a5/jobs/497177)

This test runs succesfully only if a socket CANNOT be created on port 80 in the environment where the test is executed. With recent changes to CircleCI is now possible to create a socket on port 80. As a proof of it, ssh-ing into a CircleCI runner:

```
$ TEST_PHP_EXECUTABLE=$(which php) php run-tests.php --show-out --show-diff ext/sockets/tests/socket_create_listen-nobind.phpt
...
001+ resource(4) of type (Socket)   <<<< dumping the returned socket [here](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/53ea910d1760c87b6110a461f13ebe0e244c9914/ext/sockets/tests/socket_create_listen-nobind.phpt#L17), it is supposed to return `false` instead.
...
```

The reason why this test is not failing on PHP 7.4+ if because it is skipped by this [extra check](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/9db3eda2cbaa01529d807b2326be13e7b0e5e496/ext/sockets/tests/socket_create_listen-nobind.phpt#L16-L18).

As a confirmation, running the previous test on a 7.4 runner would result in:

```
$ TEST_PHP_EXECUTABLE=$(which php) php run-tests.php --show-out --show-diff ext/sockets/tests/socket_create_listen-nobind.phpt
...
SKIP Test if socket_create_listen() returns false, when it cannot bind to the port. [ext/sockets/tests/socket_create_listen-nobind.phpt] reason: Test cannot be run in environment that will allow binding to port 80 (azure)
...
```

## `Zend/fibers/out-of-memory-in*`

ddtrace request init hook consumes more than 2 MB of memory and fails too early instead of testing what it should.

## `Zend/tests/fibers/gh10496-001.phpt`

ddtrace affects the order of destructor execution due to creating span stacks etc.

## `Zend/tests/stack_limit/stack_limit_013.phpt`

This particular test is very close to the stack limit, and thus sometimes fails to actually exceed the stack limit with ddtrace.

## `ext/zend_test/tests/`, `Zend/tests/gh10346.phpt`

Observer tests trace all functions, including dd setup. Exclude these from being observed.

## `ext/standard/tests/network/syslog_null_byte.phpt`, `ext/standard/tests/network/syslog_new_line.phpt`

Both of them have a additional `PHPT: DIGEST-MD5 common mech free` in the output which is not expected in the test. This line originates from `libdigestmd5.so` which is shipped as part of `libsasl2-modules` in Debian. We are currently running those tests on Debian Buster which is stuck on Version 2.1.27 of that package, while the "fix" is in 2.1.28 version of the Debian package.

## SKIP\_ONLINE\_TESTS

The env var `SKIP_ONLINE_TESTS` is set so that in newer PHP versions, we skip
any test which checks this env var. Online tests are too flaky for CI.

The exact PHP version that a given test checks this env var varies, but these
are some tests which are skipped for older versions which don't check it:

 - `ext/sockets/tests/socket_shutdown.phpt`
