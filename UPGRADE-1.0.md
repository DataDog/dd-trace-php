# Upgrade to dd-trace-php 1.0

**Important Notice:** Upgrading `dd-trace-php` from version 0.x to 1.0 involves several breaking changes. Please review the following changes carefully before proceeding with the upgrade.


Version 1.0 of dd-trace-php brings significant enhancements and improvements over the previous versions. Alongside various bug fixes and performance optimizations, this release introduces a revamped WordPress integration, modifications to defaults, and deprecation of OpenTracing in favor of OpenTelemetry.

- [Sampling Rules](#sampling-rules)
- [OpenTracing Deprecation](#opentracing-deprecation)
- [Removed APIs and Configuration Keys](#removed-apis-and-configuration-keys)

## Migration Guide

To ensure a smooth transition to version 1.0, follow these migration steps:
- **Check PHP Version**: Ensure your PHP version is at least 7, as PHP 5 is no longer supported starting from version 1.0.
- **Update WordPress Integration**: If you're using the WordPress integration, adjust your configuration and monitors based on the changes outlined in the document.
- **Review Sampling Rules**: Ensure your sampling rules are configured correctly, considering the switch from regex patterns to glob patterns.
- **Update Deprecated APIs and Configuration Keys**: Replace deprecated functions, interfaces, classes, and configuration keys with their respective replacements as detailed in the document.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Test your application thoroughly after the upgrade to ensure that all functionalities are working as expected.

**Note**: To ensure a smoother transition and identify potential issues, you may enable debug logs (`DD_TRACE_DEBUG=1`) to see deprecations before migrating.

## PHP 5 EOL

Starting from version 1.0, support for PHP 5 is removed. If you are using PHP 5, you can still use the PHP tracer up to version 0.99. The minimum PHP version requirement for `dd-trace-php` 1.x is PHP 7.

## WordPress

An opt-in improvement to the WordPress integration was released as a public-beta in [0.91.0](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-php/releases/tag/0.91.0). Starting version 1.0, the PHP tracer will adopt this integration.

### Configuration Changes

| Configuration Option                      | Previous Configuration Value | New Default Configuration Value |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `DD_TRACE_WORDPRESS_ENHANCED_INTEGRATION` | `false`                      | **Removed** (`true`)            |
| `DD_TRACE_WORDPRESS_CALLBACKS`            | `false`                      | `true`                          |

**Note**:
- The `DD_TRACE_WORDPRESS_ENHANCED_INTEGRATION` configuration option has been removed in favor of the enhanced WordPress integration.
- By default, `DD_TRACE_WORDPRESS_CALLBACKS` is now set to `true`. This setting enables tracing of WordPress Action Hooks' callbacks. Enabling this feature may result in a significant increase in the number of spans generated by the WordPress integration. If you prefer to disable this functionality, set `DD_TRACE_WORDPRESS_CALLBACKS` to `false`.

### Breaking Changes

While changes from the new WordPress Integration are mostly additive, some changes have been made to existing spans which could have an influence on your monitors, if any.

#### Replaced Spans

- `wp_print_footer_scripts`: If `DD_TRACE_WORDPRESS_CALLBACKS` is enabled, the operation name (resp. resource name) is changed from `wp_print_footer_scripts` to `callback` (resp. `wp_print_footer_scripts (callback)`).

- `wp_head`: The operation name (resp. resource name) is changed from `wp_head` to `action` (resp. `wp_head (hook)`).

- `load_template`: The resource name changed from `<template>` to `<template> (template)`.

#### Removed Spans

- `wpdb.__construct` and `wpdb.query`: Duplicate with the MySQL Integration spans.

- `WP_Widget.display_callback`: This method is removed in favor of tracing each `WP_Widget::widget` calls which happen during `WP_Widget.display_callback`.

## Context Propagation

|                                      | 0.x                                        | 1.0                                        |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE_EXTRACT` | `tracecontext,datadog,B3,B3 single header` | `datadog,tracecontext,B3,B3 single header` |
| `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE_INJECT`  | `tracecontext,datadog`                     | `datadog,tracecontext`                     |
| `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE`         | `tracecontext,datadog`                     | `datadog,tracecontext`                     |

## Sampling Rules

Starting from version 1.0, the library will parse `DD_TRACE_SAMPLING_RULES` as `glob` patterns by default as regexes won't be supported in sampling rules across Datadog libraries.

You can still set `DD_TRACE_SAMPLING_RULES_FORMAT` to `regex` if you want to use regex sampling rules. Note that `DD_TRACE_SAMPLING_RULES_FORMAT` becomes deprecated and will be dropped in the next PHP major release.

## OpenTracing Deprecation

Custom instrumentation with OpenTracing is now deprecated. It is recommended to switch to [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php/tree/main) instead.

## Removed APIs and Configuration Keys

Deprecated functions, interfaces, classes, and config knobs were removed. The removals are outlined below.
