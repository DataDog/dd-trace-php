--TEST--
Nested closure targeting method call 02 (posthook)
--DESCRIPTION--
In PHP 5 you cannot bind a static closure to an object. It's not always
obvious when a closure is automatically static.

In this one, we're making sure that a tracing closure still works when:
  - It is defined inside another closure that does have a scope.
  - It is targeting a method.
