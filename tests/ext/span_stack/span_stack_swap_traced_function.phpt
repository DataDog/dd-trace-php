The stack stays intact within the function: bool(true)
And the span started within the inner function was automatically closed, given that it is on the same span stack: bool(true)
We called a function on the current span stack: bool(true)
And the span stack was switched back after the function on the original stack left: bool(true)
Also, the span on the other stack was not automatically closed: bool(true)
Now, we have explicitly closed it: bool(true)
We closed the active stack after all other stacks were closed. No other span is active right now: bool(true)
