# Sample apps

This package contains a number of sample apps used to tests different web frameworks.

The test frameworks must support the following routes/endpoints in order to execute the tests in `./TestScenarios.php`:

* `/simple`: GET request that returns a string
* `/simple_view`: GET request that renders a view
* `/error`: GET request that throws an exception (returns a **500** response)

### Symfony 5.2

For Symfony 5.2 I intentionally installed the symfony/skeleton instead of the
full web skeleton; this removes dependencies we do not use like doctrine/dbal.
We had troubles with installing compatible versions of these unused dependencies
in the past.

    $ composer create-project symfony/skeleton Version_5_2 "5.2.*"
    $ cd Version_5_2
    $ composer require doctrine/annotations
    $ composer require symfony/twig-bundle
