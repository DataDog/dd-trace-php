<p>{% trans %}Any software occasionally has bugs, and sometimes these bugs have security implications. When security bugs are fixed in the core software, modules, or themes that your site uses, they are released in a <em>security update</em>. You will need to apply security updates in order to keep your site secure.{% endtrans %}</p>

Security advisories are managed by the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-security-team">Drupal Security Team</a>.{% endtrans %}</p>
