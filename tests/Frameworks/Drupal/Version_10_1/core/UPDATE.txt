INTRODUCTION
------------

This document provides links to resources on how to update or migrate your
Drupal site.


MINOR AND PATCH VERSION UPDATES
-------------------------------

Minor and patch updates are done either manually or with Composer, depending on
how the site was installed. Refer to the sections below on updating with
Composer or updating manually for tarball/zip installations.

Minor and patch versions are updates such as:
 * Patch releases (e.g. 9.1.2 to 9.1.3)
 * Scheduled minor releases (e.g 9.3.5 to 9.4.0)
 * Beta to final releases (e.g. 9.1.0-beta2 to 9.1.0)


IS MY SITE USING COMPOSER?
--------------------------

Before updating, determine if your site is currently managed by Composer.

On a typical Unix/Linux command line, this can be determined by running the
following command (replace /PATH/TO/composer with the appropriate location
for your system):

  /PATH/TO/composer info drupal/core
