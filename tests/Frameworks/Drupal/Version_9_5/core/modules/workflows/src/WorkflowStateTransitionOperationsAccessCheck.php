   * The value of '_workflow_access' is used to check to kind of access that
   * should be applied to a route in the context of a workflow and a state or
   * transition. States and transitions can individually have access control
   * applied to them for 'add', 'update' and 'delete'. By default workflows will
   * use the admin permission 'administer workflows' for all of these
   * operations, except for delete-state which checks there is at least one
   * state, a state does not have data and it's not a required state.
   *
   * For the update and delete operations, a workflow and a state or transition
   * is required in the route for the access check to be applied. For the "add"
   * operation, only a workflow is required. The '_workflow_access' requirement
   * translates into access checks on the workflow entity type in the formats:
   *   - @code"$operation-state:$state_id"@endcode
   *   - @code"$operation-transition:$transition_id"@endcode
   *
   * For example the following route definition with the path
   * "/test-workflow/foo-state/delete" the 'delete-state:foo-state' operation
   * will be checked:
   * @code
   * pattern: '/{workflow}/{workflow_state}/delete'
   * requirements:
   *   _workflow_access: 'delete-state'
   * @endcode
   *
   * @param \Drupal\Core\Routing\RouteMatchInterface $route_match
   *   The parametrized route
   * @param \Drupal\Core\Session\AccountInterface $account
   *   The currently logged in account.
   *
   * @return \Drupal\Core\Access\AccessResultInterface
   *   An access result.
   *
   * @throws \Exception
   *   Throws an exception when a route is defined with an invalid operation.
