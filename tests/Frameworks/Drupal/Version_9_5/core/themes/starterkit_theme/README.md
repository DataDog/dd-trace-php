# Starterkit Theme

## How to use Starterkit
The Starterkit theme is not directly used by Drupal, nor is it used as a base theme.
**Starterkit is for generating new themes** that include
reasonably un-opinionated templates and styles that eliminate much of the
the initial work required to create a theme.

Starterkit is the recommended approach for creating new themes. For more
information, consult the
[Starterkit documentation on Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/core-modules-and-themes/core-themes/starterkit-theme).
