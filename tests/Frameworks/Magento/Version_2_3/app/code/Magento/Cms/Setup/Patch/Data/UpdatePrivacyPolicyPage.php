        Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit
        a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application
        can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about
        your preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page
        traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for
        statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.
