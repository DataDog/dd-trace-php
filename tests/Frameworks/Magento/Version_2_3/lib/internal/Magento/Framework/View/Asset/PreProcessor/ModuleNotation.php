 * The part specific to CSS is the fact that a CSS file may refer to another file and the relative path has to be
 * based off the current location of CSS-file. So context of base path can be known ONLY at the moment
 * of traversing the CSS contents in context of the file location.
 * Other than that, the algorithm of resolving notation "Module_Name::file/path.ext" is generic
