            Validates contents in downloaded file for each export area. Note that MFTF cannot simply click export and
            have access to the file that is downloaded in the browser due to the test not having access to the server
            that is running the test browser. Therefore, this test verifies that the Export button can be successfully
            clicked, grabs the request URL from the Export button's form, executes the request on the magento machine
            via a curl request, and verifies the contents of the exported file. Uses S3 for the file system."/>
