<p>Release Date: August 20, 2011</p>

<ul>

Latin-1, UTF-8, and other "low ASCII" character sets are unaffected on all environments.</p>  <p class="critical">If you are running or considering running a multi-byte character set for your database connection, please pay close attention to the server environment you are deploying on to ensure you are not vulnerable.</p></li>

	<li>Changed server check to ensure SCRIPT_NAME is defined. (Reactor #57)</li>

<ul>
	<li>General changes
		<ul>
			<li>PHP 4 support is removed. CodeIgniter now requires PHP 5.1.6.</li>
			<li>Scaffolding, having been deprecated for a number of versions, has been removed.</li>
			<li>Plugins have been removed, in favor of Helpers.  The CAPTCHA plugin has been converted to a Helper and <a href="./helpers/captcha_helper.html">documented</a>.  The JavaScript calendar plugin was removed due to the ready availability of great JavaScript calendars, particularly with jQuery.</li>

This allows distribution of sub-applications with their own libraries, models, config files, etc. in a single "package" directory.  See the <a href="libraries/loader.html">Loader class</a> documentation for more details.</li>
			<li>In-development code is now hosted at <a href="http://bitbucket.org/ellislab/codeigniter-reactor/">BitBucket</a>.</li>

			<li>In <a href="database/forge.html">Database Forge</a> the name can be omitted from $this->dbforge->modify_column()'s 2nd param if you aren't changing the name.</li>
			<li><kbd>$config['base_url']</kbd> is now empty by default and will guess what it should be.</li>

<h2>Version 1.7</h2>
<p>Release Date: October 23, 2008<br />
Hg Tag: 1.7.0</p>

<ul>
	<li>Libraries
		<ul>
			<li>Added a new <a href="libraries/form_validation.html">Form Validation Class</a>.  It simplifies setting rules and field names, supports arrays as field names, allows groups of validation rules to be saved in a config file, and adds some helper functions for use in view files.  <strong>Please note that the old Validation class is now deprecated</strong>. We will leave it in the library folder for some time so that existing applications that use it will not break, but you are encouraged to migrate to the new version.</li>
			<li>Updated the <a href="libraries/sessions.html">Sessions class</a> so that any custom data being saved gets stored to a database rather than the session cookie (assuming you are using a database to store session data), permitting much more data to be saved.</li>
			<li>Added the ability to store libraries in subdirectories within either the main "libraries" or the local application "libraries" folder. Please see the <a href="libraries/loader.html">Loader class</a> for more info.</li>
			<li>Added the ability to assign library objects to your own variable names when you use <kbd>$this->load->library()</kbd>. Please see the <a href="libraries/loader.html">Loader class</a> for more info.</li>
			<li>Added controller class/method info to <a href="general/profiling.html">Profiler class</a> and support for multiple database connections.</li>
			<li>Improved the "auto typography" feature and moved it out of the helper into its own <a href="libraries/typography.html">Typography Class</a>.</li>
			<li>Improved performance and accuracy of <kbd>xss_clean()</kbd>, including reduction of false positives on image/file tests.</li>
			<li>Improved <a href="./libraries/parser.html">Parser class</a> to allow multiple calls to the parse() function.  The output of each is appended in the output.</li>
			<li>Added <dfn>max_filename</dfn> option to set a file name length limit in the  <a href="libraries/file_uploading.html">File Upload Class</a>.</li>
			<li>Added <dfn>set_status_header()</dfn> function to <a href="libraries/output.html">Output class</a>.</li>
			<li>Modified <a href="libraries/pagination.html">Pagination</a> class to only output the "First" link when the link for page one would not be shown.</li>
			<li>Added support for mb_strlen in the <a href="libraries/form_validation.html">Form Validation</a> class so that multi-byte languages will calculate string lengths properly.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Database
		<ul>
			<li>Improved Active Record class to allow full path column and table names:  hostname.database.table.column.  Also improved the alias handling.</li>
			<li>Improved how table and column names are escaped and prefixed.  It now honors full path names when adding prefixes and escaping.</li>
			<li>Added Active Record caching feature to "update" and "delete" functions.</li>
			<li>Added removal of non-printing control characters in <kbd>escape_str()</kbd> of DB drivers that do not have native PHP escaping mechanisms (mssql, oci8, odbc), to avoid potential SQL errors, and possible sources of SQL injection.</li>
			<li>Added port support to MySQL, MySQLi, and MS SQL database drivers.</li>
			<li>Added driver name variable in each DB driver, based on bug report #4436.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Helpers
		<ul>
			<li>Added several new "setting" functions to the <a href="helpers/form_helper.html">Form helper</a> that allow POST data to be retrieved and set into forms.  These are intended to be used on their own, or with the new <a href="libraries/form_validation.html">Form Validation Class</a>.</li>
			<li>Added <kbd>current_url()</kbd> and uri_segments() to  <a href="helpers/url_helper.html">URL helper</a>.</li>
			<li>Altered <kbd>auto_link()</kbd> in the <a href="helpers/url_helper.html">URL helper</a> so that email addresses with "+" included will be linked.</li>
			<li>Added <kbd>meta()</kbd> function to  <a href="helpers/html_helper.html">HTML helper</a>.</li>
			<li>Improved accuracy of calculations in <a href="helpers/number_helper.html">Number helper</a>.</li>
			<li>Removed added newlines ("\n") from most form and html helper functions.</li>
			<li>Tightened up validation in the <a href="helpers/date_helper.html">Date helper</a> function <kbd>human_to_unix()</kbd>, and eliminated the POSIX regex.</li>
			<li>Updated <a href="helpers/date_helper.html">Date helper</a> to match the world's current time zones and offsets.</li>

			<li>Added a file lock check during caching, before trying to write to the file.</li>
			<li>Modified Cookie key cleaning to unset a few troublesome key names that can be present in certain environments, preventing CI from halting execution.</li>

<li>Added a new feature that passes URI segments directly to your function calls as parameters. See the <a href="./general/controllers.html">Controllers</a> page for more info.</li>
<li>Added support for a function named <dfn>_output()</dfn>, which when used in your controllers will received the final rendered output from the output class.  More info in the <a href="controllers.html">Controllers</a> page.</li>
<li>Added several new functions in the <a href="./libraries/uri.html">URI Class</a> to let you retrieve and manipulate URI segments that have been re-routed using the <a href="routing.html">URI Routing</a> feature.

<li>Added some code to allow email attachments to be reset when sending batches of email.</li>
<li>Deprecated the <dfn>application/scripts</dfn> folder. It will continue to work for legacy users, but it is recommended that you create your own

<li>Deprecated the <dfn>$autoload['core']</dfn> item from the <kbd>autoload.php</kbd> file.  Instead, please now use: <kbd>$autoload['libraries']</kbd></li>
