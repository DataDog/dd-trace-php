        #   - search for 'upstream sent too big'
        # Explanation:
        #   - AVG and MAX response buffer size are 5kB in our case
        #      - How to measure: https://gist.github.com/magnetikonline/11312172#determine-actual-fastcgi-response-sizes
        #   - Page size in container is 4kB: `getconf PAGESIZE`
        #   - We need to increase that limit so the entire response can be buffered:
        #      - http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html#fastcgi_buffering
        #   - We do not want to disable buffering because otherwise nginx will start immediately sending back the
        #     response to the http client and will not be able to modify it (e.g. status code 502) in case of segfault.
