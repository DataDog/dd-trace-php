# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file - [read more](docs/changelog.md).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.22.0]

### Added
- Official support for PHP 7.3 #429
- Tracer limited mode where spans are not created to preserve resources #417

### Fixed
- Error when a subclassed integration returns an object that cannot be cast as a string #423
- initial redis auto instrumentation integration (https://pecl.php.net/package/redis)

## [0.21.0]

### Added
- `dd_trace_forward_call()` to forward the original call from within a tracing closure #284

### Fixed
- `parent::` keyword not honored from a subclass when forwarding a call from a tracing closure #284
- Private and protected callable strings not resolved properly from a tracing closure #303

## [0.20.0]

### Added
- Force tracing or discarding trace via special Span tag (manual.keep and manual.drop) #409

### Fixed
- Resource use by caching configuration values instead of processing data on every access #406

## [0.19.1]

### Fixed
- Tracing of functions called using DO_FCALL_BY_NAME opcode #404
- Curl headers not being correctly set #404

## [0.19.0]

### Changed
- Span and SpanContext main implementation uses public fields to share data to allow faster serialization and overall Span overhead #398
- `DDTrace\Encoders\SpanEncoder::encode()` now takes an instance of `DDTrace\Data\Span` instead of `DDTrace\Contracts\Span` #398
- `DDTrace\Processing\TraceAnalyticsProcessor::process()` now takes an instance of `DDTrace\Data\Span` instead of `DDTrace\Contracts\Span` #398
- Improve performance of setTag and setResource #398
- Load required PHP files in one go #387
- Load optional PHP files without filesystem check #387

## [0.18.0]

**NOTE: THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE RELEASE**

This change should not impact most users.

### Added
- MessagePack serialization for traces sent to the Agent with a new function `dd_trace_serialize_msgpack()` #378

### Changed
- Request init hook module blacklist now avoids miss matching partial matches #372
- Add 10MB cap to payloads sent to the Agent #388
- Added an `getTracesAsArray()` method to `DDTrace\Contracts\Tracer` which returns an array of spans (which are also encoded as an array.) To encode an instance of `DDTrace\Contracts\Span` as an array, use `DDTrace\Encoders\SpanEncoder::encode($span)` #378
- `DDTrace\Transport::send()` now takes an instance of `DDTrace\Contracts\Tracer` instead of an `array` #378
- `DDTrace\Encoder::encodeTraces()` now takes an instance of `DDTrace\Contracts\Tracer` instead of an `array` #378
- The default encoder is now `DDTrace\Encoders\MessagePack`. You can still use the JSON encoder by setting the environment variable `DD_TRACE_ENCODER=json`. It is generally not recommended to use the JSON encoder as parsing JSON payloads at the Agent level is more CPU & memory intensive.

- Integration-level configuration #354
- `dd_trace_disable_in_request` function which disables all function tracing until request ends #361

### Fixed

## [0.11.0]

**WARNING: THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE RELEASE**

This change should not impact most of the users as starting from `0.10.0` it is not required (and not recommended) to
manually set the transport. `DDtrace\Transport\Http` no longer accepts a logger as the second argument as it uses
the globally registered logger. If you are using the `Http` class, just remove the second argument from the constructor
invocation.

### Added
- Support for guzzle 6 #254
- Configurable Sampler #260
- Debug mode for logging #261
- Basic tracing for unsupported and custom frameworks #264
- Support for symfony 3.3 #266 and #243
- Build php 5.4 extension locally #267

### Fixed
- Composer PHP compatibility declaration #247
- Release notes for PECL and fix type-os in CHANGELOG #248
- Add missing files to PECL releases #252
- PHP 5.4 installation and build #255
- Trigger of autoloader un-tracing did not respect object #256
- docker-compose based packages verification #257
- Incorrect tar command in one-liner example from getting_started.md #258 - thanks @danielkay
- Auto-instrumentation in Symfony 3.4 and PHP 5.6 #262
- Type-o in command to install .deb packages #263

## [0.10.0]

**WARNING: THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE RELEASE**

Refer to the [Migration Guide](UPGRADE-0.10.md) for a detailed description.

At an high level here are the breaking changes we introduced:

- We removed OpenTracing as a required dependency. We still support OpenTracing, so you can do
  `OpenTracing\GlobalTracer::get()` in your code and still retrieve a OpenTracing compliant tracer, but
  OpenTracing dependency is now optional.
- We introduced auto-instrumentation and 1-step installation in place of manual registration of providers/bundles.
  Before, in order to see traces, you had to install our extension, add two dependencies to the composer file and
  add a provider (Laravel) or a bundle (Symfony). Starting from now you will only have to install the extension. You
  still have freedom to manually instrument the code, but only for advanced usage.

### Added
