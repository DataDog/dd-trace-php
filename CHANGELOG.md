## [UNRELEASED]

## [0.10.0]

**WARNING: THIS IS  A BREAKING CHANGE RELEASE**

Refer to the [Migration Guide](UPGRADE-0.10.md) for a detailed description.

At an high level here are the breaking changes we introduced:

 - We removed OpenTracing as a required dependency. We still support OpenTracing, so you can do
   `OpenTracing<GlobalTracer::get()` in your code and still retrieve a OopenTracing compliant tracer, but
   OpenTracing dependency is now optional.
 - We introduced auto-instrumentation and 1-step installation in place of manual registration of providers/bundles.
   Before, in order to see traces, you had to install our extension, add two dependencies to the composer file and
   add a provider (Laravel) or a bundle (Symfony). Starting from now you will only have to install the extension. You
   still have freedom to manually instrument the code, but only for advanced usage.
