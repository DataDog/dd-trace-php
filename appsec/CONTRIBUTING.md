# Contributing

Community contributions to the Datadog AppSec library for PHP are welcome! See below for some basic guidelines.

## Want to request a new feature?

Many great ideas for new features come from the community, and we'd be happy to consider yours!

To share your request, you can [open a Github issue](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-appsec-php/issues/new) with the details about what you'd like to see. At a minimum, please provide:

 - The goal of the new feature
 - A description of how it might be used or behave
 - Links to any important resources (e.g. Github repos, websites, screenshots, specifications, diagrams)

Additionally, if you can, include:

 - A description of how it could be accomplished
 - Code snippets that might demonstrate its use or implementation
 - Screenshots or mockups that visually demonstrate the feature
 - Links to similar features that would serve as a good comparison
 - (Any other details that would be useful for implementing this feature!)

Feature requests will be reviewed and discussed.

## Found a bug?

For any urgent matters (such as outages) or issues concerning the Datadog service or UI, contact our support team via https://docs.datadoghq.com/help/ for direct, faster assistance.

You may submit bug reports concerning the Datadog AppSec library for PHP by [opening a Github issue](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-appsec-php/issues/new). At a minimum, please provide:

 - Logs from the application or other diagnostics
 - Screenshots, links, or other visual aids that are publicly accessible
